I am Kate - energetic, happy, coffee and new relationships loving photographer.
I began my interest in professional photography in 2019. I always try in my pictures to express truthful emotions, natural beauty and lively colors, and for this I use Sony's professional equipment and edit the taken pictures in multiple of Adobe's programs.
The process of photography isn't "hold and take the picture" for me, but it is the relationship with my customer. I am your advisor and your supporter before, during and after the photographic session, so that the photoshoot goes well for you, with instead of an uncomfortable environment, a loving one.
I prepare individually for each and every photoshoot, putting all of my energy into it.
Contact me and save your happy moments not only in memory, but also in high quality pictures.
I am available in the states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
